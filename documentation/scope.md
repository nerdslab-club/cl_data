### Limitations
1. Multiple function call math is not in the scope.
2. Function overloading isn't supported.
3. N.B of Input, Output and Response Parser


for language context learning find a task, find data, separate common part,
train on that task, add that part on the main model.

So we can train part by part.

### Task: 
- Next word prediction
  - Taklami detector is a NWP model
  - https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2023/07/17/next-word-prediction-model-using-python/
- Musked word prediction. -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmnFOzmdUBE&ab_channel=DataScienceinyourpocket

NEXT Reinforcement learning:
 - Create a task.
 - Do an action.
 - Choose a reward.
